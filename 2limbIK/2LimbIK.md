# 2LimbIK
No game here, just a simple simulation of a limb with a single joint. The limb will follow the mouse.

To run:
```
$ python 2LimbIK_test.py [solution_executable]
```
For example, to play using the dummy solution,
```
$ python 2LimbIK_test.py python dummy.py
```

If you want to tweak around with the parameters, you can edit arm1, arm2, minAngle and maxAngle in 2LimbIK_test.py
