# Simple target
A simple game about dodging the bullets.

The cannon will follow the player and shoot at them at regular intervels. \
The player loses if they get shot.
The player doesn't win, much like life. Your score is printed though. \

To run:
```
$ python3 SimpleTarget_test.py [solution_executable]
```
For example, to play using the dummy solution,
```
$ python3 SimpleTarget_test.py python3 dummy.py
```
